The term "tenant" has several definitions depending on the context in which it is used: 1. **General Definition**: A tenant is a person who occupies land or property rented from a landlord. The tenant pays rent to the landlord and has the right to use the property for a specified period of time. 2. **Common Usage**: In everyday language, the term is often used to refer to someone who lives in a rented apartment, house, or room. For example, "The tenants of the building are required to follow the rules set by the management." 3. **Usage in Computer Science**: In the context of computer science, particularly in cloud computing, a tenant refers to a distinct instance or space within a multi-tenant system. A multi-tenant architecture allows multiple tenants to use the same application or service, but each tenant's data and configuration are isolated and remain invisible to other tenants. This is common in Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings. **Sentence to Remember**: "Just as a tenant enjoys privacy in their rented home, each tenant in a multi-tenant software system enjoys privacy with their data in the cloud."
